				<p><b>Information automatically collected</b></p><br>
				<p><i><b>In Short:</b>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services</i></p><br>
				<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services.

				</ul><br>
				<h5 id="fourth">4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS</h5>
				<p><i><b>In Short: </b>If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</i></p><br>
				<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p><br>
				<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
				<h5 id="fifth">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
				<p><i><b>In Short: </b>: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</i></p><br>
				<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p><br>
				<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
				<h5 id="sixth">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h5>
				<p><i><b>In Short: </b>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i></p><br>
				<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
				<h5 id="seventh">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS</h5>
				<p><i><b>In Short: </b>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i></p><br>
				<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at Ongerncar@gmail.com.</p><br>
				<h5 id="eigth">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGTHS</h5><br>
				<p><i><b></b>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</i></p><br>
				<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p><br>
				<p>If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.</p><br>
				<p><b>Withdrawing your consent: </b>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p><br>
				<p><b>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</b></p><br>
				<p><b>Account Information</b></p>
				<p> If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:<br>
				Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
				</p><br>
				<h5 id="ninth">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>
				<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p><br>
				<h5 id="tenth">10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h5><br>
				<p><i><b>In Short: </b>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</i></p><br>
				<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p><br>
				<p>
					If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).
				</p><br>
				<h5 id="eleven">11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h5><br>
				<p><i><b>In Short: </b>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</i></p><br>
